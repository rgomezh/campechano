# Hacker Project Instructions

1. Create ref_repo/ folder

2. git clone - to copy team repo to ref_repo/

3. Compare *.out files - "campechano" vs "other_team"

4. Save differences into a new folder: diff/ - "diff\_\[other_team].out"

5. Read "diff\_\[other_team].out" file and show its result

6. Move "\[other_team]_00\[i].out" -> ref\_repo/hist/ & "diff\_\[other_team].out" -> diff/hist/

7. Clean ref_repo/ & diff/

8. Repeat the process for each team: for loop
